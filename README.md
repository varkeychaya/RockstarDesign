For the Rockstar of Design Competition

The Design is an attempt to unify both webpage and mobile app. 

The goal was to create a website that when loaded on a mobile browser would behave similiar to a native app. This involves a single page which is used to store all elements and consequent interaction is aided using ajax. The elements are as lightweight as possible so that data transfer on mobile is kept to minimum. 

The goal was to keep it below 500kb, the advantage is that once loaded, only data in xml or json format will be required via ajax to complete the whole purchase process.

The entry uses javascript libraries to enable numerous subtle ui/ux features.

Testing was done at standard mobile resolutions the results of which can be seen at this url

The focus has been on the UI/UX involved and how it can be done innovatively to suit a mobile platform as well.
Content of the pages has not been a focus since most of the time was spent on perfecting the UI to be as cross compatible as possible.
